# Lab 01 - Variables

Dart has a number of variable types available to the developer.
Variables are used to store a reference to a value.

# Numbers

Dart uses integers and floats to represent numbers.

#### Use Case:

* If you need to store a whole number i.e. int myNumber = 1
* If you need to store a decimal number i.e. double = 1.5 

#### Example: 
```dart
int maxNumberOfPeople = 35;
double priceOfCakes = 2.99;
```

# Booleans 

Dart uses bool to represent a true/false scenario

#### Use Case:

* If you need to indicate something is true 
* If you need to indicate something is false 

#### Example: 

```dart
bool isDartCool = true;
bool isShopOpen = false;
```

# Strings

Dart uses strings to represent multiple characters

#### Use Case:

* If you need to store a name i.e 'Seth Ladd'
* If you need to store an address i.e. '1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA'

#### Example: 

```dart
String myFirstName = 'Seth;
String myFavouritePhrase = 'This elixir mister got a maze in vista';
```
