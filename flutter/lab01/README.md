# Lab 01 - Application Basics 

Flutter user interfaces are constructed from Widgets.
Widgets are a representation of a user interface element.
For example in the starter code application we used a Text and Floating Action Bar widgets.


To get started building an application we should understand how an application is constructed.
In the image below there is an application with two distinct pages presented.

## Main Screen

In the main screen we have a header and a list of items containing months of the year.

| Widget | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| AppBar | Header for an application |
| ListView | A grouping of information |
